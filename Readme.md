In a Programming Language Tournanment , each competition has a pair of teams (home team , away team).
When score is 0  away team wins , when 1 home team wins.
for every win a team gains 3 points
There is no draw, there is always one winner and one loser

The program returns the team  that wins the tournanment(higher score)

If 2 or more languages pass the competition with the same max score,
the Tournanment does not end , continuing to another phase of the Tournament
